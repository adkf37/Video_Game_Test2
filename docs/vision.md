# Dogsled Kart — Vision

## Elevator Pitch
A lightweight 3D dogsled racing game with arcade handling and Mario Kart–style vibes.
Single-player time-trial first; AI opponents planned for Phase 3+.

## Design Pillars
1. **Arcade feel** — responsive steering, forgiving collisions, fun boosts.
2. **Readable racecraft** — clear corners, visible track boundaries, simple hazards.
3. **Fast iteration** — minimal art requirements early; swap placeholder assets later.
4. **Single-player first** — AI opponents optional in Phase 3+.

## Core Loop
Start → Race laps → Pick up powerups → Finish → Results → Restart or Menu.

## Current Status
- Phase 0 complete: repo scaffold, main menu, placeholder sled movement on flat plane.
- Phase 1 in progress: chase camera, track, lap system, HUD.
